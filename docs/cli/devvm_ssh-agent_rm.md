# devvm ssh-agent rm

Remove a key from devvm's own SSH agent

## Synopsis

Remove a key added with devvm ssh-agent add from devvm's own SSH agent, and from ~/.local/share/devvm/agent-keys.json, so devvm doesn't load it again. The key file stays as it is, and it needn't still exist.

```text
devvm ssh-agent rm KEY_FILE [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm ssh-agent rm ~/.ssh/deploy_key  # take the key out of devvm's own agent
```

## Options

```text
  -h, --help   help for rm
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
