# devvm network lock

Lock this folder's VM to the hosts it learned, on the allowlist tier

## Synopsis

For this folder's VM, which learns the hosts it reaches, choose in a list which of the hosts it reached beyond its allowlist to add to its own rules, then give it the allowlist tier at once. Only a host on port 443 of a package registry or vendor that devvm knows, such as registry.npmjs.org, starts ticked, and risky ones are listed apart, so read the list before you confirm it. Without a terminal, --all adds every host and --none adds none, and --json lists the hosts and changes nothing.

```text
devvm network lock [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm network lock         # choose the hosts the VM keeps, then lock it to them
  devvm network lock --json  # list the hosts it learned, changing nothing
  devvm network lock --all   # keep every host it learned, without asking
```

## Options

```text
      --all      add every host the VM learned, without asking
  -h, --help     help for lock
      --here     use this folder's own VM, never that of a folder it's inside
      --json     print it as one JSON object, for scripts
      --none     add none of the hosts the VM learned, without asking
      --parent   use the VM of the nearest folder this one is inside, even across a git repo of its own
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
