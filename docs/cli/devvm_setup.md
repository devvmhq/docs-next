# devvm setup

Choose base's features, and new VMs' size, network tier, coding agents and layers

## Synopsis

Choose the features base gets, and new VMs' CPUs, memory, network tier, coding agents and layers. In a terminal devvm asks for each, starting from the current choice, and --features, --agents and --layers choose without asking. A new choice of features rebuilds base and the images on it when they're next used, and VMs you already have keep their agents and layers.

## Examples

```text
  devvm setup                        # answer every question
  devvm setup --features omb,fzf     # give base oh-my-bash and fzf, without asking
  devvm setup --features none        # give base no features
  devvm setup --agents claude,codex  # give new VMs Claude Code and Codex, without asking
  devvm setup --layers docker        # give new VMs the docker layer, without asking
```

## Options

```text
      --agents LIST     the LIST of coding agents new VMs get by default, such as claude,codex, or none
      --features LIST   the LIST of features base gets, such as fzf,omb, or none
  -h, --help            help for setup
      --layers LIST     the LIST of layers new VMs' images get by default, bottom first, such as docker,mine, or none
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
