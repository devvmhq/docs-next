# devvm agent login

Log an agent in, in this folder's VM, and save the login in devvm's store

## Synopsis

Log AGENT in inside this folder's VM, and keep the login in devvm's store for every VM with the agent, which gets only placeholders. claude logs in through a browser on any machine, whose code you paste back, or gets a long-lived Claude Code token with --setup-token. codex and opencode log in to ChatGPT in a browser on this machine, or with a code with --device-code, or save an API key with --api-key, which is pi's only login.

```text

```

## Examples

```text
  devvm agent login claude                                   # log Claude Code in to your Claude subscription
  devvm agent login claude --setup-token                     # get a Claude Code token with claude setup-token instead
  devvm agent login codex                                    # log Codex in to ChatGPT in a browser on this machine
  devvm agent login codex --device-code                      # log in with a code, in a browser on any machine
  devvm agent login opencode --api-key --provider anthropic  # save opencode's Anthropic API key, asking for it
  devvm agent login pi --api-key --provider openai           # save pi's OpenAI API key, asking for it
```

## Options

```text
      --api-key             save an API key instead, asking for it
      --device-code         log in with a code to type into a browser on any machine, so nothing is forwarded
  -h, --help                help for login
      --here                use this folder's own VM, never that of a folder it's inside
      --parent              use the VM of the nearest folder this one is inside, even across a git repo of its own
      --provider PROVIDER   with opencode's or pi's --api-key, the PROVIDER it's for: anthropic, deepseek, google, groq, mistral, openai, openrouter or xai
      --setup-token         with claude, get a long-lived Claude Code token with claude setup-token instead
      --stdin               read the secret from a line of input, without asking
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
