# devvm agent

Fill devvm's store of the agents' settings and logins that every VM gets

## Synopsis

devvm keeps the coding agents' settings in ~/.config/devvm/agents and their logins in ~/.local/share/devvm/logins, and every VM with an agent gets them from there, never from the agents' own files in your home folder. devvm agent login saves a login made in this folder's VM, devvm agent import copies those files into the store once, and devvm agent save copies a VM's settings into it.

```text
devvm agent [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm agent login codex   # log Codex in, in this folder's VM, for every VM
  devvm agent import        # copy every agent's settings and logins from this machine
  devvm agent import codex  # copy only Codex's
  devvm agent save          # copy the settings of this folder's VM's agents, after showing what changed
```

## Options

```text
  -h, --help   help for agent
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
