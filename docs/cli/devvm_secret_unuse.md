# devvm secret unuse

Stop this folder's VM using a secret

## Synopsis

Stop this folder's VM using a secret, which its proxy stops putting in at once. A VM whose image has claude always uses claude.

```text
devvm secret unuse NAME [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm secret unuse github  # stop the VM using your GitHub token
```

## Options

```text
  -h, --help     help for unuse
      --here     use this folder's own VM, never that of a folder it's inside
      --parent   use the VM of the nearest folder this one is inside, even across a git repo of its own
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
