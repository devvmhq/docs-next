# devvm secret

List the secrets kept on this machine, for VMs to use

## Synopsis

List the secrets devvm keeps on this machine, claude for the Claude Code token, github for a GitHub token, proxy for the password of the company proxy that config.toml names, and your own, with each one's hosts, header and variable, whether it's saved and the VMs using it. A VM gets a placeholder, and its proxy puts the secret into requests for the secret's hosts. No VM gets proxy, which devvm's proxies send only to the company proxy.

  devvm secret set github                                                          # save a GitHub token, asking for it
  devvm secret set stripe --host api.stripe.com --env STRIPE_API_KEY --prefix sk_  # save a secret of your own for api.stripe.com
  devvm secret use github                                                          # let this folder's VM use it
```

## Options

```text
  -h, --help   help for secret
      --json   print it as one JSON object, for scripts
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
