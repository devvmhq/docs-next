# devvm

Open a shell in this folder's VM, creating it first

## Synopsis

Open a shell in this folder's VM, at the same path, and create the VM first when the folder has none. devvm shows what a new VM gets, and in a terminal you can customize its toolchains, coding agents, layers, tier, ports and size, which --tools, --agents, --layers, --network, --ports, --cpus, --memory and --disk choose without asking. The VM mounts only this folder read-write, and with --clone it gets its own clone of the repo instead.

## Examples

```text
  devvm                                             # open this folder's VM, choosing what a new one gets
  devvm --agents claude                             # create the VM with Claude Code and the toolchains the folder needs
  devvm --tools node --agents none --layers docker  # create the VM with node and the docker layer alone
  devvm --clone                                     # create the VM with its own clone of this repo
  devvm ls                                          # list every VM
```

## Options

```text
      --agents LIST       the LIST of coding agents a new VM gets, such as claude,codex, or none (default: devvm setup's)
      --clone             create the VM with its own clone of this repo, or of each repo in this folder, instead of mounting the folder
      --cpus N            the N CPUs the VM gets (default: devvm size -g, else the image's)
      --disk GiB          the VM's disk in GiB, at least the image's (default: devvm size -g, else the image's)
      --from IMAGE        the container IMAGE base starts from, such as node:24, instead of Ubuntu's cloud image (default: $DEVVM_FROM)
  -h, --help              help for devvm
      --here              use this folder's own VM, never that of a folder it's inside
      --layers LIST       the LIST of layers a new VM's image gets, bottom first, such as docker,mine, or none (default: devvm setup's)
      --memory GiB        the VM's memory in GiB, such as 16 or 16G (default: devvm size -g, else the image's)
      --network TIER      the network TIER a new VM gets: open, internet, allowlist or none, or learn for internet while it learns the hosts it needs (default: devvm network -g's, else allowlist)
      --no-devcontainer   create the VM without reading the folder's devcontainer.json
      --no-git-protect    create the VM without .git protection
      --no-input          never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
      --parent            use the VM of the nearest folder this one is inside, even across a git repo of its own
      --ports PORTS       the PORTS the VM forwards: all, none or a list like 5173,8000-8010 (default: devvm ports -g, else all)
      --repos LIST        the repos a --clone VM of a folder of repos gets: all, none or a LIST of their paths, such as frontend,backend (default: a picker in a terminal)
      --ssh-agent         create the VM with your SSH agent forwarded, so anything in it can use your keys while you're connected
      --ssh-config        add devvm's Include line to ~/.ssh/config without asking
      --tools LIST        the LIST of toolchains a new VM gets, such as node,python, or none (default: those the folder's files call for)
      --unsafe-folder     mount a folder devvm refuses, such as your home folder
  -v, --verbose           show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
      --version           print devvm's version
