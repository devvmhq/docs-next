# devvm images

List the images and the shared tools

## Synopsis

List the images, with whether each is current, stale, unfinished or being built and the disk it takes, then the shared tools devvm has built, with how many VMs have each. It ends with what they take in all.

```text
devvm images [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm images         # list the images and the shared tools
  devvm images --json  # the same lists as JSON, for scripts
```

## Options

```text
  -h, --help   help for images
      --json   print it as one JSON object, for scripts
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
