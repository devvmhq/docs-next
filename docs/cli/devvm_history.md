```text
devvm history [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm history         # list the saved exports
  devvm history export  # save this folder's VM's agent history
  devvm history import  # put the newest export back into this folder's VM
```

## Options

```text
  -h, --help   help for history
      --json   print it as one JSON object, for scripts
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
