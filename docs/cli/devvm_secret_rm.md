# devvm secret rm

Delete a saved secret

## Synopsis

Delete a saved secret, after asking in a terminal without --no-input. A secret of your own goes with its hosts, header and variable, and the VMs using it stop using it. Proxies that are running stop putting it in at once, but what a VM did with it stays done.

```text
devvm secret rm NAME [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm secret rm github          # delete the GitHub token, after asking
  devvm secret rm github --force  # delete it without asking, as a script must
```

## Options

```text
  -f, --force   don't ask to confirm, which devvm needs without a terminal or with --no-input
  -h, --help    help for rm
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
