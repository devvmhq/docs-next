# devvm secret set

Save a secret on this machine

## Synopsis

Save a secret on this machine, claude for the Claude Code token that claude setup-token prints, github for a GitHub token, or proxy for the password of the company proxy that config.toml names. devvm asks for it without showing it, and --stdin reads a line instead. Proxies that are running put a new token in at once, and a VM's proxy reads proxy as it starts.

```text
devvm secret set NAME [flags]
```

## Examples

```text
  devvm secret set claude                          # save the Claude Code token, asking for it
  gh auth token | devvm secret set github --stdin  # save GitHub CLI's token without asking
  devvm secret set proxy                           # save the company proxy's password, asking for it
```

## Options

```text
  -h, --help    help for set
      --stdin   read the secret from a line of input, without asking
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```text
      --no-input   never ask, and fail where devvm would ask, naming the flag that answers it
  -v, --verbose    show the output of the commands devvm runs instead of a status line
```
