# SSH and editors

You can reach each running VM by name from ssh and from editors such as VS Code, and you choose for each VM whether it can use your SSH keys. [ssh into VMs](../internals/security.md#ssh-into-vms) explains how devvm's ssh entries keep a VM away from the rest of this machine.

## SSH access by name

Each running project VM can be reached as `devvm-<folder>`, as in `ssh devvm-website` or VS Code's *Remote-SSH: Connect to Host*. devvm chooses this alias once, when it makes the VM, and records it, so it never changes. A VM gets `devvm-<folder>` unless another VM already has that alias, and then its alias is its full name. So when two folders share a name, the first VM made keeps `devvm-website`, and the second one's alias is its full name, whichever of them you delete first. The VM's full name (`devvm-website-<hash>`) always works as well.

devvm writes these entries to `~/.local/share/devvm/ssh_config` each time it launches or stops a VM, because a VM's SSH port can change each time it starts. To use them, add this line to the top of `~/.ssh/config`, before any `Host` block:

```text
Include ~/.local/share/devvm/ssh_config
```

You can also point ssh at the file, as in `ssh -F ~/.local/share/devvm/ssh_config devvm-website`. `devvm host`, `devvm code` and a new [`--clone`](clone.md) VM offer to add the line in a terminal, and without one, they show it.

- **Only running VMs are listed.** A stopped VM's port is free for any program on this machine to take, so an entry for it could hand your connection, and your agent, to that program. Start the VM with `devvm host` or `devvm` before you connect from an editor.
- **Each entry checks the VM's own host keys,** which devvm reads from the VM once each time it starts and keeps in the VM's folder, `~/.local/share/devvm/vms/<hash>/run/known_hosts`. ssh refuses a host key that doesn't match, and a VM whose keys devvm can't read gets no entry.
- **Each entry reaches the VM on this machine's loopback, `127.0.0.1`,** as the VM's user with the VM's own key. A VM whose backend names any other address, or no user or key, gets no entry, so ssh never takes your connection somewhere else.
- **The entries need OpenSSH 8.7 or newer** (`ssh -V`), and an older ssh refuses them.
- **Keep remote forwards out of `Host *`.** The entries turn off what else your ssh config could share with a VM, but they can't turn off a `RemoteForward` of yours.

## devvm host and devvm code

`devvm host` gets this folder's VM ready for ssh and editors, then shows its host name (`devvm-website`) and its folder in the VM. It does what [a launch of an existing VM](../internals/overview.md#an-existing-vm) does, without opening a shell. It checks `.git`, applies the size, ports and agent forwarding that a stopped VM's state asks for, starts the VM if it's stopped, runs the [self-check](../internals/network.md#the-self-check), sets the VM up and writes the ssh config. A VM whose tier isn't enforced is stopped, and it gets no name.

`devvm code` does the same, then opens the folder in VS Code over Remote-SSH with VS Code's `code` command, as in `code --remote ssh-remote+devvm-website ~/website`. VS Code gets the SSH agent that devvm was started with, not the one that devvm's own connections to the VM carry. Without `code` on `PATH`, devvm names the host to connect to with *Remote-SSH: Connect to Host*.

### VS Code

Over Remote-SSH, VS Code reaches further than ssh:

- **Ports.** It forwards the ports that programs it starts in the VM listen on to this machine's `localhost`, whatever `devvm ports` says. Those programs include its terminals, its tasks and an agent.
- **Git sign-in.** It answers git's credential prompts in the VM with your GitHub sign-in in VS Code.

devvm turns both off in VS Code's settings for the VM, `~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json` in the VM. Each time devvm sets the VM up, it sets `remote.autoForwardPorts`, `git.terminalAuthentication` and `github.gitAuthentication` to `false` and keeps the file's other settings. A file with comments isn't plain JSON, so devvm leaves it as it is and says so in the run log.

The VM can change that file back, so for a VM you don't trust, also set the three in your own VS Code settings on this machine. Programs in the VM can also open URLs in this machine's browser (`$BROWSER`).

## Agent forwarding

SSH agent forwarding is off by default. While it's on and you're connected, anything in the VM, coding agents included, can *use* the agent's keys, for example to push or to log in to servers. It can't copy them. Turn it on for one VM when you need git over SSH there.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  choice{{"devvm ssh-agent"}}
  choice -- "off, the default" --> off["no agent:<br>git over SSH fails"]
  choice -- "on" --> on["your agent, while<br>you're connected"]
  choice -- "devvm" --> own["devvm's own agent,<br>with only the keys<br>you added"]
```

- `devvm --ssh-agent` creates the VM forwarding your agent. `devvm ssh-agent on`, `devvm` or `off` changes it for an existing VM from its next start, and `devvm ssh-agent` shows it. For a running VM, devvm asks in a terminal whether to restart it now, as `devvm restart` does, and otherwise, or without a terminal or with `--no-input`, the change waits for `devvm restart` or the VM's next start. Until then, each time devvm opens the running VM it asks in a terminal whether to restart it with the change, with no as the default unless an agent's new folders wait too ([restarting](vms.md#restarting-and-stopping)).
- The choice applies to devvm's shells and to the ssh entries alike, both as the VM's current start was made with, so a change reaches neither until the VM next starts, whichever folder devvm runs from. For a VM started outside devvm, such as with `limactl start`, they follow the current choice. When forwarding is off, an entry says `ForwardAgent no`, whatever your own `Host *` settings say, and none of devvm's own connections to the VM carry your agent.
- With forwarding off, git over SSH in the VM fails. devvm says so when it creates a VM for a repo whose `origin` is an SSH URL. Use an HTTPS remote with a GitHub token instead, or turn forwarding on.
- **No keys loaded.** When a VM forwards your agent, the agent has no keys and `~/.ssh` has one, devvm offers to load it (`ssh-add --apple-use-keychain` on macOS). To keep it loaded across reboots, add `AddKeysToAgent yes`, and `UseKeychain yes` on macOS, under `Host *` in `~/.ssh/config`.
- You can also use an agent that asks you to approve each use, such as 1Password's or Secretive.

GitHub's host keys are preinstalled in every VM, so a first connection to GitHub doesn't prompt.

### devvm's own agent

devvm's own agent keeps your other keys out of reach, because it holds only the keys you add to it, such as a deploy key or a key with access to fewer repos.

- `devvm ssh-agent add ~/.ssh/deploy_key` starts the agent and loads the key. The agent's socket is `~/.local/share/devvm/agent.sock`. `devvm ssh-agent devvm` makes this folder's VM forward that agent instead of yours, in devvm's shells and in the ssh entries alike. The entries name it as the agent, so an editor forwards it however the editor was started.
- `devvm ssh-agent` shows this folder's VM's choice, and once you've added a key, it then lists the keys devvm's agent holds, as `ssh-add -l` does, and each key you added, with its file, its fingerprint and how it's loaded. It loads the keys the agent lacks before it lists them.
- `devvm ssh-agent rm ~/.ssh/deploy_key` takes the key out of devvm's agent and out of `~/.local/share/devvm/agent-keys.json`, so devvm doesn't load it again. devvm finds the key in the agent by the fingerprint it recorded, so the key file can have changed or be gone, and devvm leaves the file itself as it is. devvm refuses a key you didn't add, and `devvm ssh-agent` lists the ones you did.
- devvm loads a key again when a VM that uses the agent launches without it, such as after a reboot or once the key's lifetime ran out, and it asks for the key's passphrase if it has one. It does so only while the file holds the key you added. `add` records the key's fingerprint, so devvm doesn't load a file that was replaced since, or a link that was swapped to another key. A key you replaced in place needs `devvm ssh-agent add` again.
- devvm refuses a key inside a folder a VM mounts, and doesn't load it, because that VM could read it. That's every folder that a VM's state says it mounts, whether the VM is running or stopped: its project folder, its agents' config folders and the shared tools. Keep the keys for devvm's agent outside project folders.
- An encrypted key in the old PEM format needs converting first, with `ssh-keygen -p -f KEY`, because devvm can't read its fingerprint without the passphrase.

The agent drops each key 12 hours after it loads it, so a VM can't keep using the key indefinitely. `--lifetime 30m` changes that for one key, and it takes a [duration](command-line.md#flags-and-values) in minutes, hours, days or weeks, such as `30m`, `8h` or `1d`, or `forever`. `--confirm` makes the agent ask you before each use, such as each push or each login, through an `ssh-askpass` program. macOS doesn't include one, so install one and put it on your `PATH`, or set `SSH_ASKPASS` to it. devvm keeps the keys and their options in `~/.local/share/devvm/agent-keys.json`, and running `devvm ssh-agent add` on the same key again replaces its options.

### devvm ssh-agent --json

`devvm ssh-agent --json` prints what `devvm ssh-agent` shows as one JSON object, as [output for scripts](command-line.md#output-for-scripts) describes. `mode` is this folder's VM's choice, `off`, `on` or `devvm`. Each of the `keys` is a key you added to devvm's agent, with its `file`, the `fingerprint` devvm recorded, `confirm`, its `lifetime` and `loaded`, which says whether the agent holds it. As without `--json`, devvm loads the keys the agent lacks first, and with no key added, `keys` is `[]` and devvm doesn't start its agent. With `--json` the command only shows, so devvm refuses `on`, `devvm` or `off` with it.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "mode": "devvm",
  "keys": [
    {
      "file": "/Users/you/.ssh/deploy_key",
      "fingerprint": "SHA256:mVPwvezndPv/ARoIadVY98vAC0g+P/5633yTC4d/wXE",
      "confirm": false,
      "lifetime": "12h",
      "loaded": true
    }
  ]
}
```
