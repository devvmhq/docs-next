# Links between VMs

A link lets a program in one of your VMs reach a TCP service in another by name, as in `postgres://db:5432/app` or `fetch("http://api:3000")`. The VM with the service is the target, and you publish its port in its folder. The VM that reaches it is the client, and you add the link in the client's folder. Links work on every backend, whatever the two VMs' network tiers, as long as the target's tier is the client's or a stricter one. devvm carries each connection over ssh through this machine, so neither VM's network changes, and [How it works › Links between VMs](../internals/ports.md#links-between-vms) explains how.

For a database in `~/code/db` and an app in `~/code/app`, both with VMs:

```sh
cd ~/code/db && devvm link publish 5432    # offer the database's port to links
cd ~/code/app && devvm link add db 5432    # programs in app's VM reach it as db:5432
```

Programs in the app's VM then reach the database as `db:5432` and as `db.devvm.internal:5432`. A link joins the two VMs' trust, so add one only between VMs you'd trust with each other's reach ([below](#a-link-joins-the-two-vms-trust)). To link several VMs to each other at once, put them in a [group](#groups).

## Publishing a port

Links reach only the ports a VM publishes, so you publish a port in the target's folder before any VM can link to it:

```sh
devvm link publish             # what this folder's VM publishes: none, or a list
devvm link publish 5432        # offer port 5432 to links
devvm link publish 8000-8010   # offer a range
devvm link unpublish 5432      # stop offering it
```

- `devvm link publish` takes ports and ranges as `devvm ports` does, such as `5432,8000-8010`, but not `all` or `none`. A port you publish is offered to links from any of your VMs, and each link is still made in its client's folder with `devvm link add`.
- `devvm link unpublish` takes ports as `devvm link publish` lists them, and it refuses a port that isn't published. The server in the VM keeps running. When other VMs link to a port you take out, devvm names them, and their next connections to that port are refused, while connections that are open stay until they close. To remove those links, run `devvm link rm` in their folders.
- A change applies at once, whether the VM is running or stopped.
- Publishing forwards nothing to this machine, and it doesn't change [the ports the VM forwards](ports-size.md#ports).

A link connects to the target's own `127.0.0.1`, so the server in the target has to listen there or on all its addresses. A server that listens on `::1` alone isn't reached.

## Adding a link

In the client's folder, `devvm link add TARGET PORT` links its VM to PORT of the VM that TARGET names, once that VM publishes the port:

```sh
devvm link add db 5432                          # reach port 5432 of the VM for the folder db as db:5432
devvm link add db 5432 --as pg                  # reach it as pg:5432 instead
devvm link add ../api 8080                      # name the target by its folder's path
devvm link add devvm-api-71a99b1076d92c 8080    # or by its VM's name
```

TARGET takes one of four forms:

- **A folder's name,** as VM names have it, such as `db` for `devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c`. devvm matches it against the folder that each VM was made for, so a VM whose backend needed a shorter name still matches its whole folder name. When more than one VM has a folder of that name, devvm refuses and lists each VM with its folder, so you can give the VM's name or the folder's path instead.
- **A folder's path,** which starts with `.` or holds a `/`, such as `../api` or `/Users/you/code/api`.
- **A VM's name,** as `devvm ls` lists it.
- **A VM's ssh alias,** such as `devvm-db`, as you'd give it to ssh ([SSH access by name](ssh.md#ssh-access-by-name)).

devvm refuses a target that has no VM, the client's own VM, and a port that the target doesn't publish. It also refuses a link that [the two VMs' tiers](#links-and-network-tiers) don't allow. When devvm makes the link, it says what the client reaches it as, and that the link joins the two VMs' trust.

### Names

Programs in the client reach a link at `NAME:PORT` and `NAME.devvm.internal:PORT`. NAME is the target's folder name, as VM names have it, unless you give `--as NAME`. `.internal` is reserved for private networks, so `NAME.devvm.internal` never names a host on the internet, and it's the name to use when the short one could clash with a name your network resolves.

- A client has one name for each VM it links to. The first link to a target sets the name, and later links to that target take it too, so after `devvm link add db 5432 --as pg`, `devvm link add db 8000` reaches `pg:8000`. To change the name, remove that target's links and add them again.
- A name is one DNS label, made of lowercase letters, digits and dashes, which starts and ends with a letter or a digit and isn't all digits. devvm refuses `localhost`, the client's own hostname and a name that another of the client's links has. When the target's folder name isn't a valid name, or it's taken, give another with `--as NAME`.
- A link is reached only by its names, never at the client's `localhost`, so `localhost:5432` in the client stays the client's own.
- A link's name hides the same name from anywhere else in the client, such as a host `db` under your network's search domain.

### Ports

The client reaches the target's port on the same port number, so `devvm link add web 80` gives `web:80`, and ports below 1024 work like any other. Two targets can publish the same port, because the client reaches each one by its own name.

Links carry TCP over IPv4 alone. Each name resolves to an IPv4 address, so a program that connects only over IPv6 doesn't reach it, and UDP isn't carried.

### Which VM a link reaches

A link stays with the VM it was made for, because devvm records the target VM's identity with the link. A VM made again in the target's folder after `devvm rm`, or another VM with the same folder name that appears later, isn't the linked target. `devvm layer add`, `devvm layer rm` and `devvm update` keep the target's identity as they make the VM again, so its links still reach it ([adding layers to a VM](images.md#adding-layers-to-a-vm)).

### A link joins the two VMs' trust

Code in the client can often run code in the target through the target's own service, such as Postgres's `COPY … TO PROGRAM`. It then has whatever the target has: its network, the secrets it may use and its project folder. devvm doesn't stop that, because it's what the service itself allows. So add a link only between VMs you'd trust with each other's reach, and publish only the ports that you mean other VMs to use. [Network tiers](../safety/network.md#links-between-vms) explains what this means for each tier.

## Links and network tiers

A client links only to a target on its own [network tier](../safety/network.md#network-tiers) or a stricter one, because a link to a target on a lower tier would let the client reach more through the target. So an allowlist client links to allowlist and none targets, but not to internet or open ones, and an open client may link to any target. When devvm can't read a client's or a target's tier, because that part of its state was changed by hand, it refuses the link rather than take it as open ([a file devvm can't read](troubleshooting.md#a-file-devvm-cant-read)).

devvm checks this rule when you add a link, at each launch of the client and on every connection ([each connection](../internals/ports.md#each-connection)):

- For a client on a confined tier, on every connection the target's tier must also be in force as the target runs. If you move the target from open to a confined tier while it's running, `devvm ls` shows it as `unenforced` until the target starts again behind its proxy, and devvm refuses the client's connections to it until then, so start the target again with `devvm restart` in its folder.
- devvm also warns you of such a target when you add a link to it, when you publish a port in its folder that the client links to, and each time the client starts. The warning names the target and refuses nothing, and devvm doesn't warn of a stopped target, because its tier applies when it next starts.

While such a link exists, devvm refuses to give the target a tier lower than a client's, such as `devvm network open` in its folder, and names the clients that link to it, and it refuses to give the client a tier higher than a target's, such as `devvm network allowlist` for a client that links to an open VM. Remove those links with `devvm link rm` first, or give the target the client's tier:

```sh
devvm link rm db 5432     # in the client's folder: remove the link to db's port 5432
devvm network allowlist   # or, in the target's folder, give the target an allowlist client's tier
```

Every VM has its proxy, so a program that uses the VM's proxy settings, such as curl, sends its requests for a link to the VM's proxy, and the proxy carries a request for one of the link's names and its port, such as `db:5432` or `db.devvm.internal:5432`, to the link. Other programs reach the link by its name directly. The proxy passes a link's connection on as it is, so it doesn't look into it and puts none of your secrets into it.

The network rules don't apply to links. The allowlist doesn't allow or block a link's connections, and `devvm network deny db` doesn't stop the link `db`. The rule above and the published ports decide which connections a link carries, and `devvm network log` shows them ([the link log](#the-link-log)). To stop a link, remove it with `devvm link rm`, or unpublish its port in the target's folder.

## Listing links

`devvm link` lists this folder's VM's links, with one row for each port:

```text
NAME  PORT  TARGET                   FOLDER              STATUS   APPLIES
db    5432  devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c  /Users/you/code/db  Running  yes
db    8000  devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c  /Users/you/code/db  Running  unpublished
```

`STATUS` is the target's status as its backend reports it, such as `Running` or `Stopped`, and it's empty when devvm can't tell. `APPLIES` is `yes` for a link that works while the target runs, or else it says why the link doesn't apply:

- `gone`: the target VM no longer exists.
- `replaced`: the target's folder has another VM, made again since the link was.
- `unpublished`: the target doesn't publish the port.
- `policy`: the target is on a lower network tier than the client.
- `ungrouped`: a [group](#groups) made the link, and the two VMs aren't in that group together any more. You can remove such a link with `devvm link rm`.

`devvm ls` shows how many links each VM has, in its `LINKS` column.

### devvm link --json

`devvm link --json` prints the same list as one JSON object, as [output for scripts](command-line.md#output-for-scripts) describes. Each of the `links` has its `name`, its `port`, the `target` VM, the target's folder as `target_folder` and its status as `target_status`, both `""` when devvm doesn't know them, `applies`, which is `true` or `false`, and `reason`, which is why the link doesn't apply, as `APPLIES` shows it, or `""` when it does.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "db",
      "port": 5432,
      "target": "devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c",
      "target_folder": "/Users/you/code/db",
      "target_status": "Running",
      "applies": true,
      "reason": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

### devvm link publish --json

`devvm link publish --json` prints what the VM publishes as one JSON object, and it only shows, so devvm refuses a list of ports with it. `ports` is `none` or a list of ports and ranges, written as `devvm link publish` takes it.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ports": "5432,8000-8010"
}
```

## Removing a link

`devvm link rm TARGET PORT` removes one of this folder's VM's links, where TARGET is the link's name or anything that `devvm link add` takes:

```sh
devvm link rm db 5432   # stop reaching db:5432
devvm link rm pg 5432   # by the name given with --as
```

The link's next connection is refused, while connections that are open stay until they close.

## When links change

A change of links reaches a running client at once and a stopped one when it next starts, and devvm says which. On a running client, the names resolve at once, because devvm rewrites the client's `/etc/hosts`, and a link's port answers within a few seconds. The VM's proxy reaches a new link as soon as its port answers, so the programs that use the VM's proxy settings also reach it, including those that were already running. Nothing in the VM restarts, and the VM's environment doesn't change, whatever its tier.

## When a target stops or goes

devvm never starts a VM for a link. A connection to a stopped target fails, and each launch of the client warns about each stopped target, until you start it with `devvm` in its folder. The client's links then work again without any change to the client. When the target stops, the connections that were open through it end. A link also needs both VMs' backends to carry links, which every backend of devvm's does, and when one can't, each launch of the client says so.

- `devvm rm` of a target removes every link to it from your other VMs and names the clients that lost one. A VM that you make again in that folder isn't linked, so publish its ports and add the links again.
- `devvm rm` of a client removes its links, and `devvm stop` of a client ends its links' connections.

A link can't listen when a program in the client already holds its port in a way that covers the link's address, such as a server of the client's own on all its addresses with the same port. That link alone doesn't work, devvm says so, and the client's other links work. Stop that program, then run `devvm restart`.

## Groups

A group is a set of your VMs that reach each other's published ports by name, without a `devvm link add` for each pair. You join each VM in its own folder, and devvm makes the links between them, so every VM in the group gets a link to each port that every other VM in it publishes. A VM is in one group at a time.

For a database in `~/code/db`, an API in `~/code/api` and an app in `~/code/app`, each with a VM:

```sh
cd ~/code/db && devvm link publish 5432 && devvm group join web
cd ~/code/api && devvm link publish 8080 && devvm group join web
cd ~/code/app && devvm group join web
```

Programs in the app's VM then reach `db:5432` and `api:8080`, programs in the API's VM reach `db:5432`, and programs in the database's VM reach `api:8080`. The links a group makes are links like any other, so what this page says about names, ports, network tiers, the link log and stopped targets holds for them too, and `devvm link` lists them.

### Joining a group

`devvm group join NAME` puts this folder's VM in the group NAME. The first VM to join makes the group, and devvm says so. A group's name is made of lowercase letters, digits and dashes, starts and ends with a letter or a digit, and isn't all digits.

```sh
devvm group join web             # join the group web
devvm group join web --as api2   # join it as api2 instead of this folder's name
devvm group                      # the group, its VMs and the ports each one publishes
devvm group leave                # leave it
```

When the VM joins, devvm makes the group's links in it and in each of the group's other VMs, and it names the links that each VM gains. The links reach a running VM at once and a stopped one when it next starts, as [When links change](#when-links-change) describes. devvm refuses a VM that's in another group already, so run `devvm group leave` first, and it refuses a VM whose backend can't carry links. A VM made again in a folder isn't in the group that the folder's old VM was in.

`devvm group` shows the group this folder's VM is in, with one row for each of its VMs:

```text
NAME  VM                        FOLDER               PUBLISHED
api   devvm-api-0f3c2a91b7d4e6  /Users/you/code/api  8080
app   devvm-app-5e1d7c08a2b9f4  /Users/you/code/app  none
db    devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c   /Users/you/code/db   5432
```

`NAME` is what the group's other VMs reach that VM by, and `PUBLISHED` is the ports it publishes, or `none`. When this folder's VM isn't in a group, devvm says so.

### Ports in a group

The group's links reach every port that a VM in it publishes, so you publish and unpublish ports in each VM's folder, as [Publishing a port](#publishing-a-port) describes. A port that you publish reaches the links of every other VM in the group, and a port that you take out goes from them, at once on a running VM and at its next start on a stopped one. devvm names the links that each VM gains or loses. A range that you publish gives a link for each port in it.

### Names in a group

The group's other VMs reach a VM by its folder name, as VM names have it, unless it joined with `--as NAME`. The name follows the rules for [link names](#names), and devvm refuses `localhost`.

- Two VMs in a group can't have the same name, so when another VM in the group has the name this VM would join as, devvm refuses the join until you give this VM another with `--as NAME`. devvm also refuses a name that's another VM's folder name, because that's the other VM's own hostname. To change a VM's name in its group, leave the group, then join it again with `--as NAME`.
- A VM's folder name is its own hostname, so devvm refuses to put a VM in a group where another VM's name is this VM's folder name, whatever `--as NAME` you give, because the name would reach the joining VM itself. For two folders with the same name, such as `~/work/api` and `~/old/api`, have the VM that's in the group leave it and join again with another name, such as `devvm group join web --as api1`, then join the other with `--as api2`. A VM whose folder has a name of its own needs neither.
- The links that you make with `devvm link add` take precedence over the group's. When you link to a VM in the group yourself, the group's links to that VM take the name your link gives it, and a port that you linked gets no link from the group. When one of your links has the name of another VM in the group, the group's links to that VM go, and devvm warns you of it, until you remove your link with `devvm link rm`.

### A group joins the trust of all its VMs

A group joins the trust of every VM in it, as [a link joins the two VMs' trust](#a-link-joins-the-two-vms-trust), because code in any of them can often run code in the others through the ports they publish. A VM that joins later gets the same reach into every VM in the group, and they get the same reach into it, so devvm says so on every join. Put VMs in a group only when you'd trust each of them with the others' reach.

### Groups and network tiers

A group's VMs are all on one tier. devvm refuses to put a VM in a group whose VMs are on another tier, and it names both tiers. It checks joins one at a time, so when two VMs join a group at once, the second is checked against the first, and a devvm that waits for another says so. While a VM is in a group, devvm refuses to change its tier with `devvm network`, so run `devvm group leave` first.

Because every VM in a group is on one tier, the group's links keep [the rule](#links-and-network-tiers) that a client links only to a target on its tier or a stricter one. Each of their connections is still refused while the target's tier isn't in force as it runs, and devvm warns you of such a target when the group makes a link to it.

### Leaving a group

`devvm group leave` takes this folder's VM out of its group. It removes the links that the group made, in this VM and in the group's other VMs, and names the links that each VM loses. The links that you made with `devvm link add` stay. `devvm link rm` doesn't remove a link that the group made, so leave the group, or unpublish the port in its target's folder.

`devvm rm` of a VM takes it out of its group, and when the group's last VM leaves, the group is gone.

### devvm group --json

`devvm group --json` prints the group as one JSON object, as [output for scripts](command-line.md#output-for-scripts) describes. `group` is the group's name, or `""` when the VM is in none, and `members` is `[]` then. Each of the `members` has its `name` in the group, its `vm`, its `folder`, and the ports it publishes as `published`, written as `devvm link publish` lists them, or `none`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "group": "web",
  "members": [
    {
      "name": "db",
      "vm": "devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c",
      "folder": "/Users/you/code/db",
      "published": "5432"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Containers in the VM

A container that the [docker layer](images.md#built-in-layers) runs in the client has a network of its own, so it neither resolves a link's names nor reaches its address. Run it with `--network host`, as in `docker run --network host IMAGE`, so it shares the VM's network and reaches the links as the VM does.

## The link log

`devvm network log` in the client's folder shows its links' connections, whatever its tier. A line has the time, `link` for a connection devvm carried or `REFUSED` for one it refused, the link's name and port, and the target VM, with why devvm refused it:

```text
2026-11-01T10:00:00Z  link     db:5432  to devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c
2026-11-01T10:05:00Z  REFUSED  db:5432  to devvm-db-71a99b1076d92c: it isn't running
```

When the client is on a confined tier and the target's isn't in force yet, the line says `unenforced`, as [Links and network tiers](#links-and-network-tiers) describes.

A client has at most 256 of its links' connections carried at once, and devvm refuses and logs the next one. [devvm network log --json](../safety/network.md#devvm-network-log---json) describes the events in JSON.
