# Troubleshooting

Each section below starts with what you see, then says what to do, with a link to the details.

## A command fails

devvm prints its own steps and sends the output of the commands it runs to a log, and when a step fails, it prints the end of that log. To watch the output as it runs, add `-v` or `--verbose` to any command:

```sh
devvm -v              # open this folder's VM, showing each command's output
devvm -v build base   # the same for any command
```

With `-v`, devvm shows each line on standard error as the log gets it, in place of the status line, and it still writes the log. When a step fails with `-v`, devvm names the log instead of printing its end again. Without `-v`, a status line in a terminal shows the step, how long it has run and the log's latest line, and a step that takes more than a few seconds leaves a line with its time.

- **The log** is `~/.local/share/devvm/logs/runs/<date>-<time>-<pid>.log`, one for each run that runs a command, which only you can read, and devvm keeps the newest 20.
- **Each command** appears in it as a `+` line with its arguments, followed by its output, and a numbered step adds a `# [2/5] <step>` line first.
- **Passwords and a VM's proxy key** stay out of it, written as `user:<password>@` and `devvm:<key>@`, including a company proxy's password from your shell's `HTTPS_PROXY` ([the run log](../internals/overview.md#the-run-log)).

## A command is refused before it runs

devvm checks a command's arguments and flags before it does anything else, so a mistyped one never reaches your VM. When one is wrong, such as a missing argument, one too many, a value the command doesn't take or a flag it doesn't have, devvm says what the command expected, then names that command's own help on the last line:

```console
$ devvm ports 5173 8080
devvm: The command devvm ports takes [all|none|LIST], not 5173 8080.
devvm: https://devvm.dev/docs/using/troubleshooting/#a-command-is-refused-before-it-runs
Run devvm ports --help to see how to use it.
```

Nothing has changed at that point, so you can fix the command and run it again.

## Exit codes

devvm exits with one of four codes, so a script can tell what happened:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The command succeeded. |
| 1 | The command failed, and devvm's error says why. |
| 2 | devvm refused the command line, such as a bad argument or flag or an unknown command, before anything ran. |
| 130 | The command was interrupted by Ctrl+C or a closed terminal ([you pressed Ctrl+C](#you-pressed-ctrlc)). |

Two programs can take devvm's place and exit with their own codes. Once devvm opens a shell in your VM, the shell replaces devvm, so the code is the shell's, and `devvm limactl` exits with limactl's code.

## A build fails

When an image's build fails in its script, or as the build VM starts or stops, devvm keeps the build VM, stopped and without a record, so you can look inside. devvm's error names the VM and says how to open a shell in it. On Lima, that's [`devvm limactl`](../backends/lima.md#running-limactl):

```sh
devvm limactl shell --start devvm-img-<key>
```

`--start` starts the VM first, outside the build's confinement. What happens next depends on the failure:

- The next build of that image deletes the VM and starts over, and `devvm gc` also deletes it.
- A build whose create or clone fails deletes the image, once devvm has shown the end of the log, because there's nothing in the image to look at.
- A first build of base also fails when the packages its VM gives back aren't exactly the packages apt downloaded, each named by its own checksum with apt's entry for it. devvm then keeps none of them, so nothing it didn't check reaches its package cache ([base's packages](../internals/images.md#bases-packages)).

Either way, the images under it, which are already built, stay. devvm deletes and builds again any image it finds without its record, such as a failed build's or one devvm couldn't clean up after a crash or a power cut.

## Not enough free space

Before each build and each new VM, devvm checks the free space on the disk that will hold it, and it refuses when there's less than the step needs. With Lima on macOS, that's 8 GiB for base, 2 GiB for another image or a VM, and from 4 GiB for one shared tool to 8 GiB for all ten, and [free space](ports-size.md#free-space) gives the numbers for Linux hosts. The message says which folder's disk it checked, how much is free and how much the step needs. Nothing has been built or made yet, so you can make room and run the same command again:

- `devvm gc` deletes stale and unfinished images and unused shared tool images ([cleaning up](images.md#cleaning-up)).
- `devvm images` lists the images and shared tool images with the space each takes, and `devvm images rm` deletes those you don't need ([deleting images](images.md#deleting-images)).
- `devvm ls` lists your VMs, and `devvm rm` deletes one. devvm never deletes a VM to make room, because a VM may hold work you haven't saved.

When devvm says it couldn't read the free space, the error after the message says why, such as a folder it can't reach.

## You pressed Ctrl+C

Ctrl+C, or closing the terminal, stops the command that's running, cleans up what the run left unfinished, and exits with code 130. A second Ctrl+C doesn't stop the cleanup. At a question, Ctrl+C ends the run at once, and devvm doesn't take an answer you type after it, so nothing goes ahead.

devvm deletes an interrupted new VM, with its state, until its first shell opens, because nothing of yours is in it yet. An interrupted build deletes the image it was building.

## base can't build on Lima

On Lima, base starts from a dated release of Ubuntu's cloud image. The first time devvm builds base, it finds the newest release on cloud-images.ubuntu.com and pins it on this machine, so that build needs to reach Ubuntu's list of releases and the release's checksums. When it can't, devvm says so and pins nothing, so check that you're online and run the command again. When the newest release doesn't boot, devvm says so and builds base from the release before it ([Ubuntu's cloud image](../internals/images.md#ubuntus-cloud-image)).

Once an image is pinned, building base again needs Lima's cached copy of it or the release itself, which Ubuntu removes after a few months. Building the same base again also needs the copies of its packages that devvm kept from its first build, and when one of them is gone or changed, devvm names it and builds nothing ([base's packages](../internals/images.md#bases-packages)). Either way, start base again from the newest release and packages:

```sh
devvm rebuild base   # pin the newest cloud image again, and install the newest packages
```

## No package source answers

The first build of base on this machine gets its packages from Ubuntu's archive, or first from the [mirror you set](settings.md#an-ubuntu-mirror). When neither answers, devvm stops at once and says so, without trying again, and it keeps the build VM stopped as for any [failed build](#a-build-fails). Check that you're online, and that the mirror's address is right, then run the command again. Building the same base again later needs neither, because devvm installs the packages it kept from the first build.

## Base gets old package lists

The first build of base checks that the package lists it got are as new as the Ubuntu cloud image it starts from, because Ubuntu's signed lists don't expire, and a server that stopped updating still serves them. When the lists for one part of the archive, such as `resolute-updates`, are more than a day older than the cloud image, devvm refuses them, keeps none of the build's packages and names that part, its date and the image. When you set a [mirror](settings.md#an-ubuntu-mirror), devvm names it, so set `ubuntu-mirror` to one that's up to date, or remove it to use Ubuntu's archive. Without a mirror, the old lists came from Ubuntu's archive itself, so check that no proxy or cache between you and the archive serves an old copy, then run the command again.

## A file devvm can't read

When devvm can't read one of its settings or state files, it names the file, and the line when the problem is on one. Fix the line or delete the file. [Your settings](settings.md#your-settings) lists what each file you edit holds, and [devvm's data folder](space.md#devvms-data-folder) what each file devvm writes holds.

A VM's own state file, `vm.json` in its folder in `vms/`, is the one to fix rather than delete, because it's what devvm knows of that VM. While devvm can't read it:

- Every command on that VM fails, and the commands that read every VM leave that VM out and carry on with the rest.
- `devvm ls` warns and lists the VM with its name and status alone, when its backend has it, and `devvm gc --orphans` never forgets it.
- devvm doesn't know which shared tools such a VM uses or which folders it mounts, so `devvm space`, `devvm images` and `devvm gc` fail and name the file.
- devvm refuses to add a key to its own SSH agent, or to load one into it as a VM starts, because it can't tell whether that VM mounts the key's folder.

## devvm says a newer release is out

When you run devvm in a terminal and a newer release is out, devvm says so in one line before it opens the VM, and it opens the VM as usual. Run `devvm upgrade` to install the release, or carry on with the devvm you have, because devvm never upgrades on its own. The line comes from devvm's daily check, and `devvm doctor` shows the newest release that check found and the day it found it. When you'd rather not see the line, set `release-check = false` in `config.toml`, or `DEVVM_NO_RELEASE_CHECK=1` in the environment ([the release check](settings.md#the-release-check)).

When devvm never says it, even though a newer release is out, the check may not have run yet, because it runs once a day and the line comes from what it found the time before. It also doesn't run while you're offline, without a terminal, with `--no-input`, for a devvm built from its source, or for a copy that neither the install script nor Homebrew installed. `devvm upgrade --check` asks GitHub at once:

```sh
devvm upgrade --check   # ask GitHub for the newest release now, and install nothing
devvm upgrade           # install it, after asking
```

## A newer devvm changed devvm's folders

devvm's data folder, `~/.local/share/devvm`, and its settings folder, `~/.config/devvm`, each record their layout version in a file named `version`, which says how devvm keeps its files there, and devvm checks both before each command. When either one has a newer version than this devvm's, a newer devvm has changed the folders, so this one refuses to run rather than misread them, and it names the file and both versions. Run the newer devvm, or upgrade this one to it, for example after going back to an older version by mistake. `devvm --version`, help and completion still run. An older version is never refused, because devvm changes the folders to its own layout before the command runs, and a folder without a `version` file gets this devvm's ([the layout version](../internals/overview.md#the-layout-version)).

## devvm names set-id files

On a Linux host, root in a VM can set the set-user-id and set-group-id bits on files in the project folder, and those bits reach this machine, so such a file runs as its owner for anyone who runs it. devvm names these files when it makes a VM and once a VM is stopped, by devvm stop or found stopped at a launch, but not at a launch into a running VM, because looking through a big folder takes a while. It names the ones that root owns apart from the rest, because those run as root, and it doesn't look in `.git` folders.

- For a file that root owns, don't run it, and delete it with `sudo rm FILE`.
- For any other file, `chmod u-s,g-s FILE` clears its bits.

Either way, don't run programs from the project folder outside the VM ([files the VM writes](../safety/attack-vectors.md#files-the-vm-writes)).

## HOME isn't an absolute path

devvm finds its folders from `HOME`, so it stops when `HOME` is empty or isn't an absolute path. Set `HOME` to your home folder, such as `/Users/you` on macOS or `/home/you` on Linux, and run devvm again.

## A VM shows as unenforced

`devvm ls` and `devvm network` show a VM's tier as `unenforced` when the VM is on a confined tier but devvm didn't start it confined. That happens when it was started outside devvm, such as with `devvm limactl start`, or when it has been running since before `devvm network` moved it from open to a confined tier, such as with `devvm network allowlist`. The VM then reaches the network without its proxy.

On the VM's next launch, devvm offers in a terminal to restart it confined, and if you decline, it warns and goes on. Without a terminal, or with `--no-input`, devvm stops the VM instead, and the next `devvm` starts it confined ([the self-check](../internals/network.md#the-self-check)). To confine it at once:

```sh
devvm restart   # in the VM's folder: start it again behind its proxy
```

If you press Ctrl+C while devvm starts a confined VM, devvm stops the VM and its proxy before it exits, so the VM never runs on without the proxy, and the next `devvm` starts both again confined.

## The proxy doesn't start

A confined VM runs only with its proxy, so when the proxy doesn't start, devvm stops the VM, and the next `devvm` starts both again. When devvm says the proxy didn't start, read the log it names for why. When it says another program took the proxy's port, devvm picks another port the next time it starts the VM, so run `devvm restart`. When the proxy doesn't stop for new settings, run `devvm stop`, then `devvm` ([the proxy](../internals/network.md#the-proxy)). An open VM runs on when its proxy doesn't answer it, and devvm warns you, because its tools that use the proxy fail, so run `devvm restart`, which starts both again.

## A request is blocked

On the allowlist tier, a VM reaches only the hosts on its allowlist, and on the none tier only its agents' and secrets' hosts. To see what the proxy blocked, run `devvm network log --blocked` on this machine, or `devvm-why` in the VM. `devvm network log --blocked` also shows the `devvm network allow` command that allows each host, and the rule applies at once, to the next connection ([logs](../safety/network.md#logs)).

## A tool that skips the proxy fails

On a confined tier, devvm's [transparent mode](../safety/network.md#tools-that-ignore-the-proxy) sends a tool that ignores the proxy settings to the proxy by the names it looks up, over HTTPS and HTTP, on ports 443 and 80 and the ports your allow rules name. Such a tool still fails in these cases, and `devvm network log` shows nothing for it, because the connection never reached the proxy:

- **A connection refused on another port,** such as `ECONNREFUSED` or `Connection refused` for `db.example.com:5432`. `devvm-why` lists the port under the connections the VM refused lately. Give the tool the proxy's address in `$HTTPS_PROXY` or its own setting, or, for HTTPS or HTTP on that port, allow the host with that port, such as `devvm network allow db.example.com:8443`, which redirects the port within 10 seconds.
- **A protocol that names no host,** such as a database's or SSH, which the proxy refuses and logs as a refused block of `transparent.devvm.proxy`. SSH in the VM goes through the proxy already, and a database client needs a proxy setting of its own.
- **A DNS error,** such as `no such host`, `Temporary failure in name resolution`, `ENOTFOUND` or `EAI_AGAIN`, which means transparent mode is off for the VM (`devvm network transparent`), or the VM comes from an image that predates it, which each launch says, and `devvm update` makes it again from a newer image. Most tools get the error at once. On a Linux host, a few, such as workerd under `wrangler dev`, wait about 40 seconds for each lookup first, so a tool that seems to hang at its start may be waiting for one.

Some tools read the proxy variables only when a setting of their own turns them on, or never. Turn on the tool's own proxy setting, so that it uses the environment, or give it the address in `$HTTPS_PROXY`. Hugo's `resources.GetRemote`, for example, uses the proxy only when `security.http.proxyFromEnvironment` is `true` in the site's config ([inside the VM](../safety/network.md#inside-the-vm)).

## A server's port is taken in a confined VM

In a confined VM, transparent mode's programs listen on the stand-in address `198.18.0.1`, on port 53 and on ports 61080 and 61443 and 61100 to 61131, so a server of yours that binds one of those ports on every address, such as `0.0.0.0:61443`, fails with `EADDRINUSE`. Ports 80 and 443 stay free for your own servers. A DNS server of yours on `127.0.0.1:53` binds, but gets no lookups, from the VM or through a forward of port 53, because transparent mode sends them to its own names. Move the server to another port, or turn transparent mode off for the VM with `devvm network transparent off`, which applies at its next launch ([tools that ignore the proxy](../safety/network.md#tools-that-ignore-the-proxy)).

## Behind a company proxy

When this machine reaches the internet only through a company proxy and nothing in a VM or a build gets through, check where devvm finds the proxy. devvm reads `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` from the shell you run it in, as `env | grep -i _proxy` shows, and when that shell sets neither `HTTPS_PROXY` nor `HTTP_PROXY`, it reads the `[proxy]` table of `~/.config/devvm/config.toml` instead ([behind a company proxy](../safety/network.md#behind-a-company-proxy)). A shell without the settings, such as an editor's terminal that didn't load your profile, starts the VM's proxy without a company proxy, unless `config.toml` names one. So set the proxy in `config.toml`, and it works from every shell:

```toml
[proxy]
https = "http://alice@proxy.example.com:8080"
http = "http://alice@proxy.example.com:8080"
no-proxy = "localhost,.example.com"
```

`config.toml` never holds the company proxy's password. Put only the user in the URL, as above, and save the password with `devvm secret set proxy`, which asks for it. Then run devvm again in the folder, which starts the VM's proxy again with the new settings:

```sh
devvm secret set proxy   # asks for the company proxy's password
devvm                    # start the VM's proxy again with the new settings
```

Other messages and cases:

- When a VM's proxy went through a company proxy the last time it started and devvm finds none this time, devvm warns you, names `config.toml` and starts the proxy without one, so the VM's requests go directly. Set the proxy in that shell or in `config.toml`, then run `devvm restart` in the folder.
- When devvm says that `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY` or one of `config.toml`'s `[proxy]` keys names an `https://` or `socks5://` proxy, ask your IT team for the proxy's `http://` address, and set that. A company proxy that inspects TLS also needs its CA, as the next section describes.
- Builds behind a company proxy go through a proxy of devvm's, which allows any host. It sends a name that this machine can't look up on to the company proxy, which resolves it ([open VMs and builds](../safety/network.md#open-vms-and-builds)).

## TLS errors behind a company proxy

When apt, `npm install`, `pip install`, `git clone` over HTTPS or an image's build fails with an error such as `certificate verify failed`, `self-signed certificate in certificate chain` or `unable to get local issuer certificate`, the network you're on may inspect TLS. Ask your IT team for the CA's certificate, or export it from this machine's store, such as Keychain Access on macOS. Put it in `~/.config/devvm/ca` and open the VM again ([a company's CA](settings.md#a-companys-ca)):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/devvm/ca && cp company-root.pem ~/.config/devvm/ca/
devvm   # open the VM again, which now trusts the CA
```

When resolving the shared tools' versions fails because this machine doesn't trust a server's certificate, mise's lines in the run log end with `invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer`. On Linux, put the CA in `~/.config/devvm/ca`, or add it to this machine's own store, as `update-ca-certificates` does on Debian and Ubuntu, and run devvm again:

```sh
# on a Debian or Ubuntu host, not in the VM (Fedora: /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ and sudo update-ca-trust)
sudo cp company-root.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/company-root.crt && sudo update-ca-certificates
```

A bundle that `SSL_CERT_FILE` names in devvm's environment works too, because that mise reads it in place of the system's. On macOS, open the CA's certificate in Keychain Access and set it to be trusted, because the part of that mise that checks where each tool's release was built trusts only what macOS trusts.

`devvm doctor` says so when `HTTPS_PROXY` or `config.toml`'s `proxy.https` is set and the folder has no CA certificates. Many proxies don't inspect TLS, so that line isn't a problem in itself. When devvm refuses a file in the folder, it names the file, and you take out anything that isn't a CA certificate, such as a private key or a server's certificate.

## A listed port isn't forwarded

When a program on this machine already has a port that the VM lists, devvm warns that the VM doesn't forward it, and the VM runs on without it. Stop that program, then run `devvm restart`, or change the VM's ports with `devvm ports`, and devvm forwards the port once it's free ([ports](ports-size.md#ports)).

devvm warns about two other reasons too, each in its own words, and `devvm ports` repeats the warning while the VM runs:

- **The VM already forwards 256 ports**, the most it forwards at once. Stop the servers you don't need in the VM, or list fewer ports with `devvm ports`, and devvm forwards the port within about 10 seconds of the VM forwarding fewer.
- **This machine doesn't let devvm use the port.** On Linux, only root can listen on a port below 1024, so a listed port such as 80 isn't forwarded. Have the server in the VM listen on a port from 1024 up and list that port instead.

## A VM won't boot

A Lima VM that doesn't answer over ssh within a minute of starting is stopped. Read its console log before you start it again, because every start overwrites the log. The log is `serialv.log`, or another `serial*.log`, in the VM's folder in devvm's Lima home, which is `~/.local/share/devvm/lima/<vm>/` unless you set `DEVVM_LIMA_HOME` ([Lima's limits](../backends/lima.md#limits)).

## A VM whose creation didn't finish

When devvm stops after it made a VM but before the VM was ready, such as when you press Ctrl+C at the wrong moment, devvm never starts that VM. The VM never opened a shell, so nothing of yours is in it. In a terminal, devvm asks whether to delete the VM and make it again, with no as the default. Without a terminal, with `--no-input` or when you answer no, devvm keeps the VM and says so, and you run `devvm rm` to delete it, then `devvm` to make it again:

```sh
devvm rm && devvm   # delete the unfinished VM, after asking, then make it again
```

While another devvm is still making the folder's VM, such as one waiting for your answers in another terminal, `devvm` and `devvm rm` in that folder refuse at once and say so. Finish or stop the other devvm, then run the command again: once the VM is made, `devvm` opens it.

## The folder is gone

When you delete or move a project folder, its VM stays and keeps its disk, and `devvm ls` writes `(gone)` after its folder. To keep the VM, move the folder back to its path. To delete it, run `devvm rm VM` with the name that `devvm ls` lists, in any folder. devvm asks first, and when the VM is stopped and has an agent, it needs `--no-export`, because starting the VM to export the history would make the folder again ([a VM whose folder is gone](vms.md#a-vm-whose-folder-is-gone)).

## The folder is on a disk that isn't connected

When a project folder is on an external disk, a USB stick or a network share that isn't connected, `devvm ls` writes `(not connected)` after its folder, and `devvm space` names the VM. Connect the disk and the VM works as before. If you mean to delete the VM, run `devvm rm VM` in a terminal and answer yes, because devvm refuses without one, even with `--force`, as the disk may still hold the project's work ([a folder on a disk that isn't connected](vms.md#a-folder-on-a-disk-that-isnt-connected)).

## The folder was made again

When you delete a project folder and make a new one at the same path, such as by cloning another repo there, devvm refuses the old folder's VM. Run `devvm rm` to delete the old VM, or `devvm adopt` to give it to the new folder ([a folder made again](vms.md#a-folder-made-again)).

## An outdated VM, or newer shared tools

devvm warns on each launch when an image the VM was made from has changed, and when there are newer shared tools than the VM's, and it leaves the VM as it is. Both warnings name `devvm update`, which moves the VM to the newest shared tools first, without asking. Then, only when the VM's image has changed, it makes the VM again from the new image, keeping its home folder, the project folder and its settings, after asking ([outdated VMs](images.md#outdated-vms)). `devvm tools update` moves the VM to the newest shared tools alone ([adding and removing tools](toolchains.md#adding-and-removing-tools)).

## A download doesn't check out

devvm checks Ubuntu's cloud image and its own mise against checksums before it uses them, and it refuses a download that doesn't match. Ubuntu's checksums must also carry a valid signature from Ubuntu's cloud image key, which devvm checks itself, with nothing to install. When devvm refuses one, try again later, and if it keeps failing, the server or the network between may be serving something else. In the same way, when `devvm rebuild base` finds Ubuntu's list of releases ending before the release that base starts from, it says so and keeps that release ([Ubuntu's cloud image](../internals/images.md#ubuntus-cloud-image)).

## A new tool release isn't there yet

A shared tool's newest release is sometimes not published for every platform yet, such as for a few days after a Node release. devvm then uses the newest older version that is, and says so, and the next daily check tries the newest again. When a release has no download for a VM's platform yet, try again the next day ([versions](../internals/images.md#versions)).

## A shared tool doesn't mount

When a VM can't mount one of its shared tools, devvm stops the launch with an error that names the VM and the tools, and the VM keeps running. That happens when the tool's image is missing from the folder that devvm keeps the shared tools in, such as after you deleted it by hand, or when the VM can't mount the image. devvm doesn't let the VM download the tool in its place, because that copy would be the VM's own, a download you didn't ask for, and one that the VM's tier may block.

```sh
devvm tools update   # in the project folder: build the missing tools, then open the shell
```

When the VM has the newest versions, `devvm tools update` builds those, and otherwise it builds the newest versions and moves the VM to them. If the launch still stops, the run log says why the VM couldn't mount the image ([a command fails](#a-command-fails)). A tool that doesn't mount never keeps the VM from booting. The VM mounts the tools it can and boots as usual, and only devvm's launch stops ([the share](../internals/images.md#the-share)).

## Reporting a bug

When none of this fixes it, open an issue on [devvm's issue tracker](https://github.com/devvmhq/devvm/issues/new/choose) and choose its form for bugs, features, toolchains, built-in layers or docs. The bug report asks for what `devvm --version`, `devvm doctor` and `limactl --version` print, your OS and its version, the command you ran with what it printed, and the run log ([a command fails](#a-command-fails)). devvm hides a VM's proxy key and passwords in the log, but it can still hold folder names, host names and a command's output, so read it before you paste it. A security problem goes to [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/devvmhq/devvm/security/advisories/new) instead, never to a public issue.
