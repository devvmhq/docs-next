# Ports and size

This page covers the ports a VM forwards to this machine and the CPUs, memory and disk it gets. You choose both when devvm makes a VM, and you can change both later with `devvm ports` and `devvm size`. [Port forwarding](../internals/ports.md) explains how devvm's forwarder works.

## Size and ports

A new VM gets its image's size unless you set one with `--cpus`, `--memory` and `--disk`, as in `devvm --cpus 6`. For `base` that's 4 CPUs, 8 GiB of memory and a 100 GiB disk. On a machine with fewer than 4 CPUs, base gets as many CPUs as the machine has, and when 8 GiB would leave the machine less than 2 GiB of its own, base gets half of the machine's memory, which is 4 GiB on an 8 GiB machine. When devvm builds base on such a machine, it says how many CPUs and how much memory base gets, and `devvm size -g` sets the size that new VMs get instead.

- `--cpus` takes a whole number. `--memory` and `--disk` take a size in GiB, written `16`, `16G` or `16GiB`, and decimals are allowed.
- What the flags leave unset comes from the `[size]` table of [`config.toml`](settings.md#configtoml) when it sets it, else from what `devvm size -g` and `devvm setup` saved ([choosing new VMs' size](#choosing-new-vms-size)).
- devvm refuses more CPUs than this machine has, and a disk smaller than the image's, because disks can't shrink. It refuses them before it builds anything.
- devvm also refuses more memory than a VM can have, because a VM that asks for all of this machine's memory doesn't start. A VM can have this machine's memory less 2 GiB, counted in whole GiB, so 6 GiB on an 8 GiB machine. On a machine with 4 GiB or less, it can have half, so 2 GiB on a 4 GiB machine. When you ask for more, devvm says how much memory this machine has and the most you can give a VM, so you can run the command again with that.

A new VM forwards every TCP port from 1024 up that it listens on, unless `--ports` says otherwise, as in `devvm --ports 5173`.

- `--ports` takes `all`, `none`, or ports and ranges such as `5173,8000-8010`.
- Without `--ports`, the default comes from `ports` in [`config.toml`](settings.md#configtoml) when it sets it, else from what `devvm ports -g` saved, and without either, a new VM forwards every port.
- When you customize a new VM without `--ports`, devvm asks whether it forwards every port, none or the ports you type, starting from the default, and saves the answer for that VM alone ([what a new VM gets](images.md#what-a-new-vm-gets)).

devvm refuses a default that isn't a valid value, as it refuses a bad flag, and for one in `config.toml` it names the file and the line ([when devvm can't read it](settings.md#when-devvm-cant-read-it)).

## Ports

A VM forwards the TCP ports it listens on to the same port on this machine's `localhost`, so a server on `:5173` in the VM is at `localhost:5173` here. To change which ports a VM forwards:

```sh
devvm ports                 # what this folder's VM forwards: all, none or a list
devvm ports 5173,8000-8010  # only these ports and ranges
devvm ports add 5432        # one more
devvm ports rm 5173         # one fewer, as listed; the last leaves none
devvm ports none            # nothing; devvm ports all forwards every port again
devvm ports -g none         # what new VMs forward (default: all)
```

- A change applies at once. A stopped VM forwards the new ports from its next start. On a running VM, devvm starts its forwarder again with the new ports while the VM runs on, so a server on an added port reaches this machine within a few seconds. The connections that were open through the old forwarder close, so a client that was connected through it has to connect again.
- `add` and `rm` take ports and ranges, not `all` or `none`. devvm refuses `rm` on a VM that forwards every port, because there's no list to remove from. `-g` also works with `add` and `rm`.
- `devvm ports -g` shows what new VMs forward, followed by where it came from after a `#`, and `devvm ports -g --json` adds it as `source`. When [`config.toml`](settings.md#configtoml) sets `ports`, `devvm ports -g` refuses to change it and names the file, so edit `config.toml` instead ([where a default comes from](settings.md#where-a-default-comes-from)).
- devvm forwards ports on every [network tier](../safety/network.md#network-tiers), and it forwards no ports from builds.

When a VM forwards every port, devvm forwards each TCP port from 1024 up that a server in the VM listens on, whether on the VM's loopback or on all its addresses. When a VM lists its ports, devvm forwards those ports alone, however many there are, ports below 1024 included. A port reaches this machine within a few seconds of the server starting, only on `localhost` (`127.0.0.1` and `::1`), and the forward goes away when the server stops. At most 256 ports are forwarded at once ([when it can't forward](../internals/ports.md#when-it-cant-forward)). Your browser sends the cookies of every app you use on `localhost` to a forwarded port as well, so the server in the VM gets them ([your browser](../safety/attack-vectors.md#the-network)).

A VM never takes a port that a program on this machine already has, a port that another running VM forwards or lists, or a port that devvm uses for its VMs' ssh and proxies ([what it never takes](../internals/ports.md#what-it-never-takes)):

- When a port you listed is taken by a program on this machine as the VM starts, or as you change its ports, devvm warns you and the VM runs on without that port. The next start or change that finds the port free forwards it.
- A program that starts on a port after the VM's forward does can still bind it on all addresses, as most servers do, and then that program's `localhost` connections reach the VM.
- When the VM's server listens on a listed port that the VM can't forward, because a program on this machine has it, the VM already forwards 256 ports, or this machine doesn't let devvm use the port, such as one below 1024 on Linux, `devvm ports` warns you and says which of these it is ([a listed port isn't forwarded](troubleshooting.md#a-listed-port-isnt-forwarded)).
- If the forwarder can't start at all, devvm warns you and names its log, and the VM runs on without forwarded ports.

**UDP isn't forwarded, on any backend.** Run the UDP client in the VM instead, or tunnel it over a forwarded TCP port with [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html), installed on both sides. For a UDP server on port 8125 in the VM, with TCP port 9125 forwarded:

```sh
socat TCP-LISTEN:9125,fork,reuseaddr UDP:127.0.0.1:8125   # in the VM
socat UDP-LISTEN:8125,fork TCP:127.0.0.1:9125             # on this machine
```

TCP is a stream, so datagrams can arrive merged or split. This suits low-rate request and response traffic, such as DNS, statsd or syslog, but not high-rate or latency-sensitive traffic, such as games, QUIC or WebRTC media.

### Two VMs and one port

Only a running VM holds a port. A stopped VM's listed ports are what it forwards when it runs again, so another VM can forward them meanwhile:

```sh
cd ~/code/a && devvm ports add 5173 && devvm stop   # a lists 5173, then stops
cd ~/code/b && devvm                                # b forwards 5173 while a is stopped
cd ~/code/a && devvm                                # a starts, and warns that b has 5173
devvm ports                                         # in a: 5173, and the same warning
```

- The running VM that forwards a port keeps it. When a VM that lists the same port starts, or you change its ports, devvm warns that it forwards the port once the other VM stops forwarding it, and `devvm ports` repeats that warning while it lasts. When the other VM stops, or stops forwarding the port, the VM forwards it within about 20 seconds, without a restart.
- A VM that lists a port comes before a VM that forwards every port. A VM that forwards every port takes no port that a running VM lists, and it gives up such a port within about 10 seconds of that VM listing it, even when the VM that forwards every port goes quiet. devvm warns about it as about any other VM.
- While devvm starts a VM again, its listed ports stay its own, so no other VM takes them in between.
- When two VMs that list the same port start at once, the first one whose server listens on the port forwards it, and the other waits for it.
- A VM that crashed holds no port, because its forwarder ends with it.
- The ports devvm chooses for VMs' ssh, proxies and desktops never take a port that any VM lists, running or not.
- `devvm ports` also warns when a program on this machine has one of a running VM's listed ports, which the VM then doesn't forward.

**While a VM is stopped, another VM serving on its port gets that port's place in your browser.** Your browser keeps site data, storage and service workers for `localhost:5173` whichever VM answers there, as it would for two projects that use one port on any machine. A service worker that the other VM's app registered can keep answering for `localhost:5173` after the first VM takes the port back, so clear that site's data in your browser when you switch.

## Size

To see or change a VM's size:

```sh
devvm size                         # what this folder's VM has: cpus=4 memory=8GiB disk=100GiB
devvm size --cpus 6 --memory 16    # change it; what isn't given stays
devvm size --disk 200              # a bigger disk; never a smaller one
devvm size -g --memory 16          # the size new VMs get (default: the image's)
devvm size -g                      # cpus=, memory= and disk= lines, empty for the image's, each with its source
```

- The flags take the same values as for a new VM and have the same limits, so devvm refuses more CPUs than this machine has and more memory than a VM can have ([size and ports](#size-and-ports)). `devvm size -g` checks a default size in the same way when you set it. A VM that already has more memory keeps it and still starts, because devvm checks a size only when you set one.
- `devvm size -g` ends each line with where its value came from, after a `#`: the path of [`config.toml`](settings.md#configtoml), `devvm: settings.json` for what `devvm size -g` or `devvm setup` saved, or `devvm: default` for the image's. When `config.toml` sets `cpus`, `memory` or `disk`, `devvm size -g` refuses to change that one and names the file, so edit `config.toml` instead ([where a default comes from](settings.md#where-a-default-comes-from)).
- A stopped VM gets its new size when it next starts, such as with `devvm`, and until then `devvm size` shows what the VM has now and says what changes. For a running VM, devvm asks in a terminal whether to restart it now, which stops anything running in it, and if you answer yes, devvm restarts it as `devvm restart` does. Otherwise, and without a terminal or with `--no-input`, the VM keeps its size until it next starts, for example with `devvm restart`. When devvm opens the running VM while its new size still waits, it asks once more in a terminal, with no as the default unless an agent's new folders wait too, and a yes restarts the VM with its new size before the shell opens ([restarting](vms.md#restarting-and-stopping)).
- Disks grow but never shrink, so devvm refuses a disk smaller than the VM's.

### Choosing new VMs' size

devvm asks for the CPUs and memory that new VMs get on your first run, before it asks which features base gets, and again whenever you run `devvm setup`:

```sh
devvm setup                         # asks its questions, the size among them
devvm size -g --cpus 6 --memory 16  # only the size, without asking
```

Before the two questions, devvm says how many CPUs and how much memory this machine has. Each question shows in brackets the value new VMs get now. That's what [`config.toml`](settings.md#configtoml) sets or `devvm size -g` saved, or else base's own size fitted to this machine: 4 CPUs and 8 GiB, or less on a machine that doesn't have room for them ([size and ports](#size-and-ports)). Confirm to keep the value, or enter another one. devvm checks what you type as it checks `--cpus` and `--memory`, and when this machine can't give it, devvm says why and asks again.

devvm doesn't ask for a value that `config.toml` sets, and says so. It saves only the values you type, where `devvm size -g` saves them, and keeps a saved disk size as it is. When you keep both values, devvm saves nothing, so new VMs go on getting the image's size. Either way, devvm prints the size new VMs get. A new size changes only the VMs made after it, and nothing is rebuilt, so existing VMs keep their size until you change it with `devvm size`.

The first run asks once, because that run also chooses base's features, and devvm asks only before they're chosen. It asks only when all of these hold ([questions devvm asks](command-line.md#questions-devvm-asks)):

- devvm runs in a terminal
- no size is set
- you didn't give `--cpus` or `--memory`

Without a terminal, or with `--no-input`, devvm asks nothing, and new VMs get the image's size. `devvm setup` asks only in a terminal, without `--no-input`, and only when you give it no flags ([devvm setup](settings.md#devvm-setup)). To set the size without asking, use `devvm size -g --cpus N --memory GiB`, which takes the same values and has the same limits.

### Disk use

A VM's disk size is how far the disk can grow, not how much space it takes. A project VM starts as a copy of its image's disk that shares the image's blocks, so a new VM takes almost nothing until it writes ([clones and overlays](../internals/lima.md#clones-and-overlays)):

- **macOS:** the copy is an APFS clone. `du` counts the shared blocks as the clone's own, so it overcounts.
- **Linux:** the copy is a qcow2 overlay of the image's disk, which holds only the VM's changes, about 12 MB for a new VM instead of 2 GB.

### Free space

Before devvm builds an image or makes a VM, it checks the free space on the disk that will hold it, and it refuses to start the step when there's less free than the step needs:

| Step | macOS | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| building `base` | 8 GiB | 8 GiB |
| building any other image | 2 GiB | 8 GiB |
| building shared tool images | 3 GiB, and 0.5 GiB for each tool | 9 GiB, and 0.5 GiB for each tool |
| making a VM | 2 GiB | 2 GiB |

devvm rounds each number up to whole GiB, so building one shared tool with Lima on macOS needs 4 GiB, and building all ten needs 8 GiB. Each build checks again before it starts, so the first VM on a Mac, which builds base, needs 8 GiB free. A tools build also checks the disk of devvm's data folder, where the shared tool images come out, and [free space](../internals/images.md#free-space) explains which disks devvm checks, what each one needs and how the numbers were measured.

`devvm doctor` also warns when that disk has less free space than building base needs, but the warning doesn't make doctor fail. When devvm refuses, see [Not enough free space](troubleshooting.md#not-enough-free-space) for how to make room.

## As JSON

`devvm size --json` and `devvm ports --json` print what the commands show as one JSON object, as [output for scripts](command-line.md#output-for-scripts) describes. With `-g`, they print the same fields for new VMs. With `--json` they only show, so devvm refuses `--cpus`, `--memory`, `--disk` or a list of ports with it.

`devvm size --json` has `cpus`, `memory_gib` and `disk_gib`, and leaves out what isn't set. For `-g`, that's what new VMs take from the image. When the VM's size changes at its next start, `pending` has the `cpus`, `memory_gib` and `disk_gib` that change.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "cpus": 4,
  "memory_gib": 8,
  "disk_gib": 100,
  "pending": {
    "memory_gib": 16
  }
}
```

With `-g`, `devvm size --json` also has `sources`, which says where each of `cpus`, `memory` and `disk` came from: `config.toml`, `settings.json` for what devvm saved, or `built-in` for the image's ([where a default comes from](settings.md#where-a-default-comes-from)).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "cpus": 6,
  "memory_gib": 16,
  "sources": {
    "cpus": "settings.json",
    "disk": "built-in",
    "memory": "config.toml"
  }
}
```

`devvm ports --json` has `ports`, which is `all`, `none` or a list of ports and ranges, written as `devvm ports` takes it. With `-g`, it also has `source`, which is `config.toml`, `settings.json` or `built-in`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ports": "5173,8000-8010"
}
```

When another running VM forwards some of the VM's listed ports, `devvm ports --json` also has `held_by`, with each such VM's `vm`, its name, and `ports`, the ports it forwards that this VM waits for ([two VMs and one port](#two-vms-and-one-port)).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ports": "5173,8000-8010",
  "held_by": [
    {
      "vm": "devvm-b-0123456789abcd",
      "ports": "5173"
    }
  ]
}
```
