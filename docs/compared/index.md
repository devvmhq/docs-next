# Compared to other tools

devvm gives each project folder a VM of its own on your machine, with the project's toolchains shared read-only between VMs, a proxy on this machine that confines the VM's network, and your secrets kept outside the VM. Other tools sandbox coding agents in other ways: in a microVM, in an OS sandbox around the agent's process, or on a vendor's servers. This page sets devvm beside the ones you're most likely to weigh it against.

## Boundary and where it runs

| | Boundary | Runs on | Project files | Open source | Account and cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| devvm | a full VM with its own kernel, on Lima | macOS 13 or newer and Linux, on arm64 or x86_64 | mounted read-write at the same path, or the VM's own clone with `--clone` | yes, MIT | no account, free |
| [Docker Sandboxes](docker-sandboxes.md) | a microVM with its own kernel and Docker Engine | macOS 14 or newer on Apple silicon, Windows 11, Ubuntu 24.04 or newer, and Docker's cloud | mounted read-write, a private clone, or none | no | a Docker sign-in; free locally, cloud paid by use |
| NVIDIA OpenShell | containers on Kubernetes, Podman or Docker with Landlock and seccomp, or a microVM you choose | Linux, macOS on Apple silicon through Docker Desktop, and Windows through WSL2 as an experiment | copied in and out | yes, Apache-2.0 | no account, free |
| microsandbox | a microVM with its own kernel, running as root inside | macOS on Apple silicon, Linux and Windows | mounted read-write by default | yes, Apache-2.0 | no account, free locally |
| smolvm | a microVM with its own kernel | macOS on Apple silicon, Linux and Windows, and its own cloud | mounted | yes, Apache-2.0 | no account locally; cloud plans from $0 a month plus use |
| Claude Code's sandbox | an OS sandbox around Claude Code's shell commands, not its file tools, hooks or MCP servers | macOS, Linux and WSL2 | the folder itself | the sandbox yes, Apache-2.0; Claude Code no | an Anthropic account |
| Codex CLI | an OS sandbox around Codex's commands | macOS, Linux, WSL2 and Windows | the folder itself, writable in workspace-write mode | yes, Apache-2.0 | a ChatGPT account or an API key |
| nono | an OS sandbox, no VM | macOS, Linux and WSL2 | the folder itself | yes, Apache-2.0 | no account, free |
| GitHub Codespaces | a VM for each codespace, on GitHub's servers | the browser or your editor | the repo cloned into the codespace | no | a GitHub account; a monthly quota free, then paid by use |

## Network and credentials

| | Network by default | Rules by | API keys | Agent logins | Agents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| devvm | the allowlist tier: devvm's built-in hosts, your secrets' hosts and yours, enforced outside the VM | host and port | placeholders in the VM, real values added by the proxy on this machine | made through the proxy or imported, kept and refreshed on this machine, with placeholders in the VM | Claude Code, Codex, opencode and pi |
| Docker Sandboxes | a preset you choose at first run: open, balanced or locked down | host, and HTTP method, path and query | placeholders in the VM, real values added by a proxy on the host | kept on the host for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Droid, with placeholders in the VM; you log in to Claude Code inside the sandbox, and one login serves every sandbox | Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Devin, Docker Agent, Droid, Gemini, Kiro and OpenCode |
| NVIDIA OpenShell | deny for hosts no rule names; method and path rules only log by default | host, port and the calling program, and method and path if you turn them on | placeholders from providers | not documented; providers take API keys from your environment | Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex and GitHub Copilot CLI, in your own image |
| microsandbox | public internet open, private addresses refused | domain, address and port | placeholders, over TLS that the host intercepts | its Claude Code guide logs in inside the VM | any, with a guide for Claude Code |
| smolvm | off | host and address range | placeholders in headers, and in form bodies if you turn it on | not documented | any |
| Claude Code's sandbox | an allowlist that starts empty | domain | masked, if you turn it on | runs on your machine | Claude Code |
| Codex CLI | off in workspace-write mode | domain, with its optional proxy | not documented | runs on your machine | Codex |
| nono | open | domain and path, and method and path for a credential's service | placeholders for each service you name | runs on your machine | Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, OpenCode and others |
| GitHub Codespaces | open | none | environment variables in the codespace | in the codespace | any |

## How devvm differs

Of the tools on this page, only devvm shares toolchains read-only between VMs, so a second project that needs node uses the same copy as the first, and nothing in a VM can change it. devvm detects the toolchains from the project's files and reads a project's `devcontainer.json`. It locks a folder's `.git` hooks and config against the VM, so the VM can't add a hook that runs on this machine, which Docker Sandboxes' docs say its direct mode doesn't prevent. Its network confinement holds even against root in the VM, because devvm enforces it from outside the VM. A VM can [learn the hosts it needs](../safety/network.md#learning-the-hosts-a-vm-needs) and then keep the ones you choose, much as OpenShell shows you the hosts it blocked so that you can approve them.

devvm keeps each agent's login on this machine and refreshes it there, so a confined VM never holds it, and Docker Sandboxes does the same for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and Droid. In both, one login for each agent serves every VM. On devvm's open tier, a program in the VM can go around the proxy and keep a login that it makes there.

## What devvm doesn't do

- devvm runs on macOS and Linux, on Lima, and Windows support is coming soon. Docker Sandboxes, microsandbox, smolvm and Codex CLI run on macOS, Linux and Windows.
- Its rules apply to the whole VM, while OpenShell's rules can also name the program that may reach each host.
- It has no snapshots of a VM, which smolvm's checkpoints and Docker Sandboxes' templates give.
- It has no SDK or API for driving VMs from a program, though most commands have `--json` output.
- It checks at most once a day whether a newer release is out, which `release-check = false` turns off, and it sends nothing else.

[Known limits](../using/limits.md) and [Attack vectors](../safety/attack-vectors.md) list the rest.

## Other tools

- **Clawk** and **agent-vm** are closer to devvm in shape, with a VM for each folder on your machine. Clawk denies outbound traffic by default, but it forwards your SSH agent, and its tip for Claude Code signs every sandbox in with your Claude Code token. agent-vm runs Lima as devvm does, makes every `.git` read-only for the VM from your machine and asks you before the VM writes files such as `.envrc` and `.vscode/tasks.json`, but the VM reaches the whole internet unless you add domain rules.
- **Lima's own recipe** for coding agents mounts only the project folder, or syncs it and asks before the VM's changes reach your machine, and it leaves the network and API keys to you.
- **Dev Containers** run in a container, which shares this machine's kernel or Docker's VM, and set no network policy. Claude Code's reference container adds a firewall allowlist, and its docs warn that it doesn't stop a malicious project from sending out what's in the container, Claude Code's login included.
- **Hosted sandboxes,** such as E2B, Vercel Sandbox, Fly.io Sprites and exe.dev, run on the vendor's servers, so your code and keys go there, and each needs an account.
