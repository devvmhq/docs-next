# Everyday commands

This page lists devvm's commands in the groups that `devvm --help` shows them in, and each row links to the page with the details. `devvm COMMAND --help` shows a command's examples and flags, [the command line](../using/command-line.md) covers what works the same in every command, and the [CLI reference](../cli/index.md) has every command with all its flags.

## Your VM

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `devvm` | open a shell in this folder's VM, at the same path, making the VM first with the toolchains, agents and layers you choose, or that `--tools`, `--agents` and `--layers` name ([details](../using/images.md#what-a-new-vm-gets)) |
| `devvm restart` | stop this folder's VM, start it again and open a shell in it, for changes that apply only when it starts ([details](../using/vms.md#restarting-and-stopping)) |
| `devvm stop` | stop this folder's VM ([details](../using/vms.md#restarting-and-stopping)) |
| `devvm update [--force] [--no-export] [--clean-home]` | move this folder's VM to the newest shared tools, and when its image or its `devcontainer.json` has changed, make it again from the image's new build and the file as it is now, keeping its home folder and settings, after asking, then open a shell in it ([details](../using/images.md#outdated-vms)) |
| `devvm rm [--force] [--no-export] [--no-clone-check]` | delete this folder's VM after asking, exporting its agents' history first unless `--no-export` ([details](../using/vms.md#deleting-a-vm)) |
| `devvm rm VM [--force] [--no-export] [--no-clone-check]` | delete a VM whose folder is gone, by its name or ssh alias, after asking ([details](../using/vms.md#a-vm-whose-folder-is-gone)), or one whose folder is on a disk that isn't connected, only after asking in a terminal ([details](../using/vms.md#a-folder-on-a-disk-that-isnt-connected)) |
| `devvm adopt` | use the VM made for an earlier folder at this path here ([details](../using/vms.md#a-folder-made-again)), or the VM made for this folder before you moved or renamed it ([details](../using/vms.md#a-moved-or-renamed-folder)) |
| `devvm adopt VM` | move a VM whose folder is gone to this folder, such as a copy of that folder on another disk, after asking ([details](../using/vms.md#a-moved-or-renamed-folder)) |
| `devvm ls` | list the project VMs ([details](../using/vms.md#listing-vms)) |
| `devvm code` | get this folder's VM ready as `devvm host` does, then open its folder in VS Code over Remote-SSH ([VS Code](../using/ssh.md#vs-code)) |
| `devvm desktop [--clipboard] [--no-open]` | serve this folder's VM's desktop on `127.0.0.1` with its password until Ctrl+C, and open it in Screen Sharing on macOS ([details](../using/desktop.md)) |
| `devvm host` | get this folder's VM ready for ssh and editors, and show the host name they reach it by, such as `devvm-website` ([details](../using/ssh.md#devvm-host-and-devvm-code)) |
| `devvm history` | list the exports of agents' history that devvm saved in `~/.local/share/devvm/exports` ([details](../using/coding-agents.md#history)) |
| `devvm history export [FILE]` | save the history of this folder's VM's agents to FILE, or to a new `.tar.gz` in `~/.local/share/devvm/exports` ([details](../using/coding-agents.md#history)) |
| `devvm history import [FILE]` | put the agents' history in FILE, or in the newest export devvm saved for this folder, into this folder's VM ([details](../using/coding-agents.md#importing-history)) |

In a folder without a VM of its own, each of these commands but `devvm adopt` uses the VM of the nearest folder with one that it's inside, and says which VM that is. `--here` and `--parent` choose which VM a command uses ([a subfolder](../using/vms.md#a-subfolder)).

These options are for a new VM, and only `devvm` takes them. A VM that exists ignores them with a warning ([what a new VM gets](../using/images.md#what-a-new-vm-gets)).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `--tools LIST\|none` | the toolchains the VM gets, such as `--tools node,python`, in place of those the folder's files call for ([details](../using/images.md#what-a-new-vm-gets)) |

| `--layers LIST\|none` | the layers the VM's image gets, bottom first, such as `--layers docker`, in place of those `devvm setup` chose ([details](../using/images.md#what-a-new-vm-gets)) |
| `--network TIER` | create the VM on a [network tier](../safety/network.md#network-tiers): `open` reaches anything this machine can, `internet` any public host, `allowlist`, the default, only the hosts you allow, and `none` only its agents' and secrets' hosts and its links |
| `--clone` | create the VM with its own clone of the repo, or of each repo in a folder of repos, instead of mounting the folder ([details](../using/clone.md)) |
| `--repos all\|none\|LIST` | with `--clone` in a folder of repos, the repos the VM gets a clone of, such as `--repos frontend,backend`, in place of the picker ([details](../using/clone.md#folders-of-repos)) |
| `--no-git-protect` | create the VM without `.git` protection |
| `--ssh-agent` | create the VM forwarding your SSH agent, so while you're connected, anything in it can use your keys ([details](../using/ssh.md#agent-forwarding)) |
| `--unsafe-folder` | mount a folder that devvm refuses, such as one that is or holds your home folder ([details](../using/settings.md#project-folders-devvm-refuses)) |
| `--cpus N`, `--memory GiB`, `--disk GiB` | the VM's size ([details](../using/ports-size.md#size-and-ports)) |
| `--ports all\|none\|LIST` | which ports the VM forwards ([details](../using/ports-size.md#size-and-ports)) |

| `devvm clone fetch [--json]` | fetch the VM's work into every repo it has a clone of, and list the new or moved branches, each with its repos ([details](../using/clone.md#fetching-the-vms-work)) |
| `devvm clone add PATH` | copy one more repo of a folder of repos into the VM, at the same path ([details](../using/clone.md#adding-a-repo)) |
| `devvm rm` | delete the VM, first offering to keep the work you haven't fetched as `saved/devvm/<branch>` branches ([details](../using/clone.md#deleting-the-vm)) |
